# Pybooks

This repository contain Jupyter notebooks I use to explore features within the Python language and ecosystem.

Unless stated otherwise (on a notebook) assume that requirements are denoted on `requirements.txt` and that a `virtualenv` named `venv` is used for dependency isolation.

A set of recommended VSCode extensions is also included.
